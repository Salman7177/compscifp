1. What advice would you give yourself if you were to start a project like this again?   

	I would advise our group to start off less ambitious, create that, and then work on incorporating new features one at a time from there. This would ensure that things are created in an orderly fashion where features build on top of each other. This would also help with development as sometimes, when developing, you are creating a feature that relies on the use of another feature which has not been created yet, so you have to wait for it. 
 
2. Did you complete everything in your must have list? If no, why not?

	From the list of features we must include, we included everything we aimed for.
 
3. Did you complete everything in your nice to have list? If no, why not?

	There were many features that we brainstormed that would be cool to have, however they were quite a lot of work for the amount of time we had. Some of these ideas included image posting, which would have required a lot of redesigning how we store posts. And where would the images be stored? In our database, or as a url on the internet? When we were in the brainstorming phase we thought of a lot of ideas to have, but during development we had to start with the more basic, doable, and fundamental ideas that would give our project body, before we were able to develop any larger, more complicated ideas, such as the image posting which we left out.
 
4. What was the hardest part of the project?

	The hardest part of this project would have to be organizing our components all into one project at the end. Many times during development we were waiting on another person’s part to be finished as the two parts needed each other to fully function. Afterwards when the time came to put things together, this was also quite challenging. Some of us had never worked in a coding environment with others before, so the working-together aspect of this project was a big challenge.
 
5. Were there any problems you could not solve?

	During our development we were able to get past all of our coding problems we faced. The only aspect or problem we couldn’t get were the large scale ambitious features on our want-list that we chose to leave out. But in terms of what we chose to keep in and work on, we were able to create and code those features successfully.
