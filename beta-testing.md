# Beta Testing 

## Feedback from peers

      * Liked the user login and sign up
      * Liked being able to see posts from other users 
      * Pointed out errors that needed to be fixed

With this feedback, we were able to catch errors and fix them quickly.
It also helped reinforce some of the good ideas we had
